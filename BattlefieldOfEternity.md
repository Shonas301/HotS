# Battlefield of Eternity

## Recommended Heroes:

## Tips:
- The goal in the immortal fight should be to deal damage to the enemy immortal,
- if you do not then the immortal will come with 100% shield and FUCK YOU UP
  
- When drafting make sure you have a faster race or better teamfight

- Do the hard (shaman) camp before immortal starts, as they can push while we
- immortal fight and maybe force a 5v4

## Lane Assignments
The Top and Bottom lanes are identical. If you have a heavy champion which can
soak a top lane its best to send it solo and then do a 4 laner on first blood
and try and take an outer tower before objectives spawn. If you lack siege to
push you might want to match hero for hero until objective.
